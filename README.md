# Quote Generator Full

This project combines the front-end and back-end of a quote generator application. The front-end is built with Angular (TypeScript), and the back-end is built with Java.

## Project Structure
- **Root Directory**: Contains the front-end (Angular) application.
- **backend/**: Contains the back-end (Java) application.

## Front-End (Angular)

The front-end was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.12.

### Development Server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Unit Tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running End-to-End Tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further Help
To get more help on the Angular CLI, use `ng help` or check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Back-End (Java)

The back-end is a Java application, likely using Spring Boot (based on typical Java project structures).

### Prerequisites
- Java (version compatible with your project, e.g., Java 17)
- Maven

### Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the back-end directory:
   ```
   cd backend
2. Install dependencies :
